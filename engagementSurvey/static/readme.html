                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This survey software was made for HRMP, for the easy distribution of employee engagement surveys. It is designed to be managed by an administrator at HRMP, who has access to all data generated by client employees. This is to be packaged and distributed to clients in an anonymised form. </p>

							<h3>Basics</h3>

                        <p>I use $ to refer to the root URL of this project.

                            This project makes extensive use of the Django administrator interface at $/admin/engagementSurvey/ . This is the where the administrator has access to companies, questions and employees, and can directly view response data. These can be added, removed, and changed from this interface.
                            <br><br>
                            The basic entities used in this project are <code>Company, Employee, Question, Answer</code>, and each can be changed in the Django admin. This is the main place where questions are added, and associated with a company. Questions can be associated with many companies, but we assume that one company asks <i>one set of questions to all employees</i>. Companies and employees are more difficult to create (but easy to delete) from the Django admin. However, password protected forms are available to easily set up new companies with employees. This is discussed below.

                        </p>

						<h4>Setup</h4>
                    </header>
                    <p> <b>Companies</b> can be added with the password protected form at $/engagementSurvey/new/ . This allows the easy creation of a company with a specifable number of employees. Each company must receive a descriptive name (E.g. Example Company) and a two digit company code (e.g. EC).
                        <br><br>
                        Each <b>Employee</b> is associated with a unique id (e.g. EC12345), and a link is generated for that employee to follow and complete the survey. $/engagementSurvey/Example%20Company/EC12345/
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Questions</b> must be manually added to each company with the <i>Django admin</i>. A list of all all questions ever asked in the survey application is viewable in the company page in the admin, and a set of question is selected by Ctrl/Command+Click. New questions can be also be added with the '+' button. This means that, at the moment, one company sends the same set of questions to all employees, regardless of employee type and level.
                        
                    </p>
                    <header>
                            <h4>Distribution</h4>
                    </header>
                    <p>    
                        Employees must be emailed one link each, which gives them access to the survey. This acts like the login for an employee. Each link can be used once, after which the survey will display a message saying that this link has already been used.
                        <br><br>
                        Employees then move to a two page survey:
                        <br>
                        1. Employee details: Department and level.
                        <br>
                        2. Actual survey: Questions that have been added to the <code>Company</code> in the admin.
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <header>
                            <h4>Data</h4>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Survey response data is saved in individual answers to questions. These <code>Answer</code> objects are associated with a company and employee.
                        <br>
                        A password protected results page ($/engagementSurvey/CompanyName/results) shows which employees have responded, along with a list of their responses.
